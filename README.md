# EssentialCommands
A remake of Bukkit's Essentials plugin. This will also include built in plugins like groupmanager (remade), editors, and probably a few more things once I get this fully sorted out.

Progress:
- Groupmanager: 0%
- LoginClearance: 0%
- ServerProtect: 0%
- BannerManager: 0% (redoing this)
- Essentials: 40%
- Entire plugin: 35%

Possible/planned features:
- Revamped version of LoginClearance
- Server codes plugin
- External Mail receiving feature (this might be cancelled)
- Revamped version of ServerProtect
- Banner Creator
- Placed sign editor.
- Custom MOTD per world (option)
- Probably a few other things.
